# Minimalist Pincode Weather Forecast App

A simple, single-file web application that fetches and displays the current weather and a 5-day forecast for a given US pincode, featuring a clean user interface and subtle visual feedback.

## How to Use

To get this application up and running:

1.  **Obtain an OpenWeatherMap API Key:**
    *   Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
    *   Sign up for a free account.
    *   Navigate to your API keys section and copy your personal API key.

2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    *   Save the provided `index.html` content as `index.html` on your local machine.
    *   Open this file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

3.  **Configure API Key:**
    *   Edit the `index.html` file.
    *   Locate the JavaScript section (`<script>...</script>`).
    *   Find the line `const API_KEY = 'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY';`
    *   Replace `'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY'` with the actual API key you obtained from OpenWeatherMap.

4.  **Enter Pincode and Get Weather:**
    *   In the web page, enter a US pincode (e.g., `90210`, `10001`, `60601`) into the input field.
    *   Click the "Get Weather" button or press `Enter`.
    *   The application will display the current weather and a 5-day forecast for that location.

## Code Explanation

This project is a self-contained web application within a single `index.html` file, leveraging pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

### HTML Structure

The HTML provides a straightforward layout:
*   A main container (`.container`) wraps all elements.
*   An input field and a button (`.input-section`) for user interaction.
*   Placeholder paragraphs for loading messages (`#loadingMessage`) and error alerts (`#errorMessage`).
*   A hidden `div` (`#weatherDisplay`) that becomes visible to show the weather data, containing:
    *   A section for current weather (`.current-weather`), displaying city, temperature, description, icon, and detailed stats (min/max temp, humidity, wind).
    *   A section for the 5-day forecast (`.forecast-section`), which includes a grid (`#forecastGrid`) where individual forecast cards are dynamically injected.

### CSS Styling

All CSS is embedded within a `<style>` tag in the HTML `<head>`.
*   It uses CSS variables (`:root`) for easy theme customization (background colors, text colors, etc.).
*   Flexbox and CSS Grid are utilized for responsive layout, ensuring a pleasant experience across different screen sizes.
*   Styling is applied to create distinct cards for current weather and forecast items, with subtle hover effects (`transform`, `box-shadow`) for an interactive feel.
*   A simple `keyframes` animation (`@keyframes pulse`) is applied to the current temperature to give a gentle visual "pulse", contributing to the "amazing animations" aspect in a minimalist way.
*   Basic media queries are included for responsiveness on smaller devices.

### JavaScript Logic

The JavaScript code is embedded within a `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>` for optimal loading performance.
*   **API Integration:** It interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API:
    *   `api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/zip`: To convert a given pincode (assuming US) into geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) and retrieve the city name.
    *   `api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`: To fetch current weather conditions using the obtained coordinates.
    *   `api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast`: To retrieve a 5-day/3-hour forecast for the location.
*   **DOM Manipulation:** It dynamically updates the HTML elements based on the fetched data.
*   **Error Handling & Loading States:**
    *   Includes checks for empty pincode input and an unconfigured API key.
    *   Displays loading messages (`#loadingMessage`) during API calls and appropriate error messages (`#errorMessage`) if data fetching fails.
*   **Weather Icons:** The `getWeatherIcon` function maps OpenWeatherMap's standard icon codes to visually intuitive Unicode emoji characters (e.g., `‚òÄÔ∏è`, `‚òÅÔ∏è`, `üåßÔ∏è`), maintaining a minimalist approach without requiring external image assets.
*   **Forecast Processing:** The `renderForecast` function processes the 3-hour interval forecast data to select a single, representative entry (e.g., closest to noon) for each of the next five days, providing a cleaner daily forecast view.
*   **Event Listeners:** An event listener is attached to the "Get Weather" button for clicks and to the pincode input field for the `Enter` keypress, triggering the `fetchWeather` function.
